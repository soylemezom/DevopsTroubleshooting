ERROR DESCRIPTION OUTPUT:After initializing kudeadm 
root@ip-172-31-3-84:/# sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
I0320 03:51:49.234117    5239 version.go:256] remote version is much newer: v1.29.3; falling back to: stable-1.28
[init] Using Kubernetes version: v1.28.8
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks
error execution phase preflight: [preflight] Some fatal errors occurred:
        [ERROR CRI]: container runtime is not running: output: time="2024-03-20T03:51:49Z" level=fatal msg="validate service connection: validate CRI v1 runtime API for endpoint \"unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock\": rpc error: code = Unimplemented desc = unknown service runtime.v1.RuntimeService"
, error: exit status 1
[preflight] If you know what you are doing, you can make a check non-fatal with `--ignore-preflight-errors=...`
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher
SOLUTION 
Correct configuration is specified for the endpoint "unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock" and enabled the plugin instead of disabled.
Added below code in /etc/containerd/config.toml
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd]
endpoint = "unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock"

systemctl restart containerd
