We need to change the Docker cgroup driver by creating a configuration file `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and adding the following line then restart deamon, docker and kubelet:

{
"exec-opts":["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}       

We  specified an execution option for Docker. This particular option, "native.cgroupdriver=systemd", sets the control group (cgroup) driver to systemd. This is typically done to ensure Docker containers can properly integrate with systemd for managing system services.

sudo service docker restart
