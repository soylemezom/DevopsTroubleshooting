How to migrate to the Kubernetes community-owned repositories?

Debian, Ubuntu, and operating systems using apt/apt-get

1-Replace the apt repository definition so that apt points to the new repository instead of the Google-hosted repository. Make sure to replace the Kubernetes minor version in the command below with the minor version that you're currently using:

echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

2-Download the public signing key for the Kubernetes package repositories. The same signing key is used for all repositories, so you can disregard the version in the URL:

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

Update: In releases older than Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04, the folder /etc/apt/keyrings does not exist by default, and it should be created before the curl command.

3. Update the apt package index: sudo apt-get update

4-sudo apt-get install kubeadm kubelet kubectl
